## Character Profiles

### Elisandre (Eli)

- Role: Protagonist, healer, apprentice to [[Veridis]]
- Age: 24
- Location: [[Vandalia]], a border village in [[Thessaly]]
- Goal: Learn enough to heal people fully and develop safe ways of teaching so others aren't hurt the way she was
- Wound: The [[Blacksmith's Daughter]]'s incomplete recovery. Eli tried to help during a crisis but didn't know enough — damaged herself in the process and couldn't achieve a complete recovery. The BS daughter survived but was left with lingering illness and a changed gift. Eli carries guilt and determination.
- Fear: That her ignorance will hurt someone again. That the limits everyone accepts are real.
- Voice Markers: Curious, direct, sometimes misses social cues (ADHD/ASD spectrum light). Observational rather than intuitive about people. Functional in speech — says what she means without ornamentation.
- Hard Constraints: She is NOT innately special. She becomes remarkable through persistent training, observation, and inquiry. She figures things out through experimentation, not through being taught or having special powers. Magic has faded over generations "like art being redrawn through a grapevine," and Eli's gift is her willingness to question what everyone else accepts.
- Physical: Average height, slender build from years of physical work. Brown hair tied back practically. Hazel eyes that shift color with the light (Tor notices this). Hands rough from herb preparation and healing work. Beautiful but does not emphasize it — prefers functionality over presentation.
- Personality: Curious about things that feel different. Family and community oriented. Not interested in a relationship initially (this develops through the novel). Interested in magic and how far she can push healing.
- Background: Raised in a modest family in [[Vandalia]]. Apprenticed to [[Veridis]] at age 12 after relentlessly pestering him. Her family does construction work.
- Relationships:
  - [[Torsten (Tor) Vance]] — slow-burn love interest. Makes her feel *seen*, not just wanted. Starts as enemies-to-friends (he's never mean, just takes time to trust others). Eli won't pick up on his walls coming down because she doesn't read social cues easily.
  - [[Callion (Cal) Aldervane]] — first relationship. Conditional love that teaches her what she doesn't want. Calls her "Ellia" — trying to feminize her, make her softer. Her reclaiming "Eli" becomes a turning point.
  - [[Veridis]] — mentor figure. Absent but influential. Trained her since age 12.
  - [[Kira]] — best friend. Sharp-tongued support.
  - [[Thess]] — close friend.
  - [[Aldric Venn]] — father figure/leader. Believes in her potential. Is the librarian.
  - [[Kyria (Ky)]] — younger sister, 14 at the start of the story.
  - [[Rennick]] — brother, 23. Invested in his community. Has an interest in taking over their parents' construction work.
  - [[Blacksmith's Daughter]] — the crisis that drives Eli's core emotional arc
  - [[Bellinger family]] — runs the mill in Vandalia (Eli's relationship to them TBD)
- Starting Inventory and Access: healer's supplies, herb preparation tools, knowledge of traditional healing practices (dogmatic, not experimental)
- The Name: Cal calls her "Ellia" — trying to feminize her, make her softer. Her reclaiming "Eli" becomes a turning point in the breakup arc.

### Torsten (Tor) Vance

- Role: Slow-burn love interest
- Goal: TBD
- Wound: TBD — something that makes him slow to trust others
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: TBD
- Hard Constraints: Never mean. His distance is caution, not cruelty. Starts as enemies-to-friends with Eli. He notices details about her (eye color changes) that suggest close, quiet observation.
- Relationships:
  - [[Elisandre (Eli)]] — makes her feel *seen*, not just wanted. The relationship builds from friction through trust to love.
- Starting Inventory and Access: TBD
- Notes: The dynamic works because Eli doesn't read social cues well and Tor is slow to open up — two people circling each other at different speeds for different reasons, and neither fully aware of the other's internal timeline.

### Callion (Cal) Aldervane

- Role: Eli's first relationship — conditional love
- Goal: TBD
- Wound: TBD
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: TBD
- Hard Constraints: Represents conditional love that teaches Eli what she doesn't want. Calls her "Ellia." The breakup happens in Book 1.
- Relationships:
  - [[Elisandre (Eli)]] — romantic relationship. He tries to soften her into something more palatable. The relationship ends when she stops allowing it.
- Starting Inventory and Access: TBD

### Veridis

- Role: Eli's mentor, healer and teacher
- Goal: TBD
- Wound: TBD
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: TBD
- Hard Constraints: Dies in Book 2 passing on crucial knowledge to Eli. Absent but influential — what does "absent" mean? Physically distant? Emotionally distant? Both?
- Relationships:
  - [[Elisandre (Eli)]] — apprentice since she was 12. She pestered him relentlessly.
- Starting Inventory and Access: TBD
- Notes: Key unknown: does Veridis understand magic more deeply than he teaches? Is his "absence" related to pursuing knowledge the institution suppresses?

### Kira

- Role: Eli's best friend
- Goal: TBD
- Wound: TBD
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: Sharp-tongued. Supportive but not soft about it.
- Hard Constraints: TBD
- Relationships:
  - [[Elisandre (Eli)]] — best friend
- Starting Inventory and Access: TBD

### Thess

- Role: Close friend to Eli
- Goal: TBD
- Wound: TBD
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: TBD
- Hard Constraints: TBD
- Relationships:

- Starting Inventory and Access: TBD

### Aldric Venn

- Role: Father figure/leader, librarian
- Goal: TBD
- Wound: TBD
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: TBD
- Hard Constraints: Believes in Eli's potential. As librarian, he occupies a unique position — keeper of written knowledge in a world of oral dogma.
- Relationships:
  - [[Elisandre (Eli)]] — father figure. Sees her potential.
- Starting Inventory and Access: access to the library/archive (significant in a dogmatic society)
- Notes: A librarian who believes in a curious young woman's potential. In a society built on unquestioned ritual, the person who guards the books is either the most conformist figure or the most quietly dangerous one.

### Kyria (Ky)

- Role: Eli's younger sister
- Age: 14 at start
- Goal: TBD
- Wound: TBD
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: TBD

- Wound: Left with lingering illness and a changed gift after Eli's incomplete healing attempt
- Fear: TBD
- Voice Markers: TBD
