## Secrets

### S-001: The wards may not work

- `secret_id`: S-001
- `claim`: The wards that Vandalia performs as ritual may have no actual protective function — or their function has degraded beyond relevance
- `known_by`: unknown (possibly no one fully understands this yet)
- `unknown_to`: all of Vandalia — the question itself is unthinkable
- `why_hidden`: cultural blindness — the wards are so deeply embedded as ritual that questioning their function is like questioning breathing. The institution reinforces this by making dogmatic practice the only acceptable relationship with magic.
- `reveal_trigger`: TBD
- `reveal_plan`: TBD
- `narrative_stakes`: if the wards don't work, everything Vandalia assumes about its safety is a comfortable fiction. The discovery doesn't just threaten physical security — it threatens the entire epistemological foundation of their culture.
- `partial_clues`: TBD — what small signs might a perceptive character notice?
- `status`: hidden
- `first_relevant_chapter`: 1
- `linked_notes`: [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[culture_and_society]], [[religion]]

### S-002: Wild beast attacks are occurring

- `secret_id`: S-002
- `claim`: Attacks from wild beasts have been happening — small tales exist, but no one in Vandalia is aware
- `known_by`: unknown — someone outside Vandalia, possibly those who benefit from Vandalia's isolation
- `unknown_to`: all of Vandalia
- `why_hidden`: mix of natural isolation and deliberate information control — Vandalia is cut off enough that news doesn't travel easily, and there are those who benefit from keeping it ignorant
- `reveal_trigger`: TBD
- `reveal_plan`: TBD
- `narrative_stakes`: the beasts represent a real, physical threat that the ward-ritual may not address. This secret gates S-001 — if the beasts are real, the wards become testable, and testability is what dogma cannot survive.
- `partial_clues`: the "small tales" — rumors, travelers' stories, things dismissed as exaggeration
- `status`: hidden
- `first_relevant_chapter`: 1
- `linked_notes`: [[ecology_and_environment]], [[locations]], [[factions]]

### S-003: Magic can be understood, not just performed

- `secret_id`: S-003
- `claim`: Magic has underlying mechanics that can be studied, experimented with, and potentially improved — it is not a fixed liturgy
- `known_by`: TBD — possibly no living character yet, or possibly someone outside the institution. Eli will discover this through persistent inquiry.
- `unknown_to`: all of Vandalia, including the institution that enforces dogma
- `why_hidden`: the institution's authority rests on magic being received wisdom, not a system to be interrogated. If magic can be understood, the institution loses its role as sole keeper of correct practice. But also: magic has degraded over generations "like art being redrawn through a grapevine" — the original understanding is lost, so no one even knows there's something to discover.
- `reveal_trigger`: Eli's experimentation and observation — her refusal to accept "this is how it's always been done"
- `reveal_plan`: slow-burn across the full series. Eli stumbles into this through healing work, not through grand revelation.
- `narrative_stakes`: this is the foundational secret. It reframes the entire world. Magic-as-dogma keeps society rigid, hierarchical, and afraid. Magic-as-system opens the door to change, autonomy, and danger.
- `partial_clues`: Eli's healing work occasionally produces unexpected results. Small moments where doing something slightly different yields something slightly better. The kind of thing a less curious person would dismiss.
- `status`: hidden
- `first_relevant_chapter`: 1 (Eli's curiosity is present from the start, even if she doesn't know what she's discovering)
- `linked_notes`: [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[factions]], [[themes]], [[character_bible]]

### S-004: Eli attracts monsters after injury

- `secret_id`: S-004
- `claim`: After being injured, Eli seems to draw the attention of the beasts/monsters. There is a connection between magical practitioners (or magical injury) and the creatures.
- `known_by`: no one initially — this is discovered through events in Book 1
- `unknown_to`: everyone, including Eli
- `why_hidden`: the connection between practitioners and beasts hasn't been observed because Vandalia has been isolated from the attacks. Eli's injury creates the first observable data point.
- `reveal_trigger`: the monster attack in Book 1 (arc beat 2.5)
- `reveal_plan`: mid Book 1 — this is the event that shatters Vandalia's isolation and makes S-002 real
- `narrative_stakes`: if magic use (or magical injury) draws the beasts, then the dogmatic practice Vandalia relies on may be actively dangerous — not just useless but a beacon. This raises the stakes on S-001 enormously: the wards might not just fail to protect, they might attract the threat.
- `partial_clues`: TBD — does Eli feel something before the attack? Do animals behave strangely around her after the injury?
- `status`: hidden
- `first_relevant_chapter`: mid Book 1 (after BS daughter crisis)
- `linked_notes`: [[character_bible]], [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[ecology_and_environment]]

### S-005: The Blacksmith's Daughter's changed gift

- `secret_id`: S-005
- `claim`: The Blacksmith's Daughter had a gift before the crisis. Eli's incomplete healing attempt didn't just leave her with lingering illness — it changed the nature of her gift.
- `known_by`: Eli (partially — she knows the healing was incomplete), Blacksmith's Daughter (she experiences it)
- `unknown_to`: what the change means, what caused it, and what it implies about magic's deeper mechanics
- `why_hidden`: in a world of dogma, a "changed gift" has no conceptual framework. There's no language for it. It's treated as damage, not data.
- `reveal_trigger`: TBD — does the changed gift manifest in unexpected ways?
- `reveal_plan`: TBD
- `narrative_stakes`: the changed gift may be evidence that magic is mutable — that it responds to interaction, not just performance. This could be an early, unrecognized proof of S-003.
- `partial_clues`: whatever the Blacksmith's Daughter can now do (or can't do) that she could before
- `status`: partially_revealed (the damage is known; its meaning is not)
- `first_relevant_chapter`: 1
- `linked_notes`: [[character_bible]], [[magic_or_tech_systems]]

## Reveal Trajectory

| Order | Secret ID | Gated By | Target Arc Beat | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | S-005 | — | Book 1 early — BS daughter crisis establishes the wound | partially_revealed |
| 2 | S-002 | — | Book 1 mid — first cracks in Vandalia's isolation | hidden |
| 3 | S-004 | S-005, S-002 | Book 1 mid — Eli's injury draws the beasts, connecting practitioners to threat | hidden |
| 4 | S-001 | S-002, S-004 | Book 1 late / Book 2 — beasts + practitioner connection makes wards testable | hidden |
| 5 | S-003 | S-001 | series-spanning — once dogma fails, the question becomes "what else is possible?" | hidden |

## Known Unknowns

- Who specifically benefits from Vandalia's ignorance about the beast attacks?
- Does the institution know the wards don't work, or are they as blind as everyone else?
- Has anyone ever experimented with magic and been punished, or has the thought simply never arisen?
- What is the mechanism connecting Eli's injury to the monster attraction?
- What was the Blacksmith's Daughter's original gift, and what did it become?
- Does Veridis know more about magic's mechanics than he teaches?
