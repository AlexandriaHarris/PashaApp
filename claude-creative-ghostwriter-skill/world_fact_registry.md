# World Fact Registry

## Purpose

Track provenance, certainty, and verification state of world facts. Only `confirmed + locked` entries are treated as hard canon during chapter drafting. All other entries remain soft until the user explicitly confirms them.

## Fact Entries

### WF-001: Magic is dogma

- `fact_id`: WF-001
- `claim`: Magic in Vandalia is practiced as dogma — no experimentation, no flexibility, no questioning of methods
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[culture_and_society]], [[religion]]
- `notes`: This is the foundational constraint of the world. Magic is not a science to be explored — it is a liturgy to be performed.

### WF-002: Wards are unquestioned ritual

- `fact_id`: WF-002
- `claim`: Wards are performed as inherited ritual — people do them because that's what's always been done, not as conscious protection. No one frames them as "defense."
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[culture_and_society]]
- `notes`: The wards are so embedded that questioning their function would be absurd — like asking why you breathe.

### WF-003: Whether magic/wards actually work is unknown

- `fact_id`: WF-003
- `claim`: No one in Vandalia knows whether the wards (or magic more broadly) actually function as intended, or function at all
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[knowledge_map]]
- `notes`: This is the central dramatic irony. The entire culture rests on practices whose efficacy has never been tested.

### WF-004: Wild beast attacks have occurred

- `fact_id`: WF-004
- `claim`: Small tales of attacks from wild beasts exist. These attacks are real events.
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[ecology_and_environment]], [[knowledge_map]]
- `notes`: The beasts are a real threat. The "small tales" suggest limited scale so far — or limited reporting.

### WF-005: Vandalia is ignorant of beast attacks

- `fact_id`: WF-005
- `claim`: No one in Vandalia knows about the wild beast attacks
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[knowledge_map]], [[factions]], [[locations]]
- `notes`: The ignorance is a mix of natural isolation and deliberate information control by those who benefit from keeping Vandalia unaware.

### WF-006: An institution enforces magical rigidity

- `fact_id`: WF-006
- `claim`: A specific institution controls how magic is practiced, but its authority rests on a deeper cultural assumption that makes questioning magic feel absurd. The institution and the assumption reinforce each other.
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[factions]], [[religion]], [[politics_and_power]], [[culture_and_society]]
- `notes`: The institution doesn't need to punish heretics often because heresy barely occurs to anyone. But the institution exists, which means it has structure, hierarchy, and interests.

### WF-007: Vandalia's ignorance is partly maintained by interested parties

- `fact_id`: WF-007
- `claim`: Some of Vandalia's isolation from news of beast attacks is organic, but there are also parties who benefit from keeping Vandalia ignorant
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[factions]], [[knowledge_map]], [[politics_and_power]]
- `notes`: Who benefits and why is still open — this is a key unknown that shapes the conspiracy layer of the story.

### WF-008: Vandalia is a border village in Thessaly

- `fact_id`: WF-008
- `claim`: Vandalia is a border village in Thessaly. It is a farming community that grows wheat communally. The Bellinger family runs the mill.
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[locations]], [[economy]], [[factions]]
- `notes`: Border village — bordering what? The border position may explain both the isolation and the vulnerability to beast attacks. The communal farming and single-family mill create a tight economic interdependence.

### WF-009: Magic has degraded over generations

- `fact_id`: WF-009
- `claim`: Magic has faded over generations "like art being redrawn through a grapevine" — each generation's practice is a slightly degraded copy of the one before
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[timeline]], [[themes]]
- `notes`: This metaphor implies the original magic was richer and more understood. What's left is ritual stripped of comprehension — form without function. This explains why nobody questions it: you can't question what you've never seen done differently.

### WF-010: Eli is a healer, apprenticed to Veridis since age 12

- `fact_id`: WF-010
- `claim`: Elisandre (Eli) is a 24-year-old healer from Vandalia, apprenticed to Veridis at age 12 after relentlessly pestering him. She is NOT innately special — she becomes remarkable through persistent training, observation, and experimentation.
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[character_bible]], [[magic_or_tech_systems]]
- `notes`: Eli's willingness to question is her defining trait. In a world of dogma, her curiosity is effectively heretical — even if she doesn't frame it that way initially.

### WF-011: Eli attracts monsters after being injured

- `fact_id`: WF-011
- `claim`: During Book 1, Eli seems to attract monsters after she is injured
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[character_bible]], [[knowledge_map]], [[magic_or_tech_systems]], [[ecology_and_environment]]
- `notes`: This implies a connection between magical practitioners (or magic use/injury) and the beasts. Why injury specifically? Does healing magic leave a signature? Does damage to a practitioner create an opening?

### WF-012: Blacksmith's daughter crisis

- `fact_id`: WF-012
- `claim`: Eli attempted to heal the Blacksmith's Daughter during a crisis. She lacked sufficient knowledge, damaged herself in the process, and achieved only an incomplete recovery. The BS daughter survived but was left with lingering illness and a changed gift.
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[character_bible]], [[knowledge_map]]
- `notes`: "Changed gift" implies the BS daughter had a gift before the crisis — one that was altered by the incomplete healing. This is a key unknown: what was the gift, and how did it change?

### WF-013: Three-book series structure

- `fact_id`: WF-013
- `claim`: The story spans three books — Threads (Book 1), Resonance (Book 2), Legacy (Book 3). Eli's arc goes from untrained healer to teacher (Blue Lantern) to leader of practitioner network who faces the Deep.
- `source`: user_stated
- `status`: confirmed
- `verification_state`: locked
- `confidence`: high
- `first_introduced`: worldbuilding session 1
- `impacted_notes`: [[outline]], [[character_bible]]
- `notes`: "The Deep" is the ultimate antagonistic force. Eli seals the breach through connection, not control — this thematic choice (connection over domination) should echo through all three books.
