# Text-Grounded Question Template

Use this format when asking user questions about story text or canon.

## Question

- `prompt`:
- `question_type`: factual_recall | causal_reasoning | constraint_check | novelty_probe | decision
- `source_basis`: what text/canon this question is based on
- `relevance_now`: why this question is needed for the current chapter decision
- `expected_answer_shape`: short_fact | choice | brief_explanation
- `linked_notes`: [[outline]], [[character_bible]], [[timeline]], [[style_guide]]

## Quality Check

- Is the question answerable from provided text/canon context?
- Does it directly affect chapter planning, continuity, or style control?
- Is it specific enough to avoid generic responses?
